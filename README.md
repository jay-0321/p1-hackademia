Hackadamia uses frontend technology like HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

Hackadamia's challenges during it's software development phase was small, team members living in different time zones, but we made sure eveyone was supported and got the develpment completed on time. Future features we gope to implement for Hackadamia includes animated icons, scrolling right/left feaures to view different topics, the chance to add more topics to the forum and allow users to folow each other. 

To use Hackadamia you need to sign up with a username, email and password. Returning users need to sign in to their accounts and navigate to the threads/forum page. You can find any topic you need related to your search or you can scroll down the page through the different topics. Users will be taken to the Topics page once they choose a hack ie. CAR HACK, COOKING HACK, and can access the help they need from this page. Users will also have user page where they can save the topics they choose and submit their own topics.
